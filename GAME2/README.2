Hi Chris,
       Here is the final music for Hero.

       0 - Title Music
       1 - Game complete music
       2 - Quest done fanfare
       3 - In game music
       4 - Game over fanfare

       Please use the tunes like this. Also could you put on the title page
       somewhere "Music By [Neil Baldwin of] Eurocom Developments". The bit
       in brackets if you can fit it on !

       Oh before I forget, the RAM has changed again (I had to take out a bit
       of the music player so I would have enough memory to do a game over
       tune; this freed up two variables) so now the RAM starts from
       $0783 giving you TWO more bytes ! God knows how I got all the music
       in 6k but I bet your grateful !

       Also PLEASE use the correct version of the music i.e. NTSC/PAL as
       I went to great lengths to do both versions so they would sound the
       same. (If you play the same music on both PAL & NTSC the notes are
       different in pitch as well as being different speeds. I had to
       generate a whole new note table for the PAL version !)

              The NTSC music that you need is call "NTSCHERO.MUS"
              The PAL music is called "PALHERO.MUS"

       One last thing, could you send me the ROM images for Hero as I
       would like to see (Hear !) it with the music in.

              See you soon
                            Neil.
